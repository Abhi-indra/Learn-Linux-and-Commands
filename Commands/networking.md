**Network Management Commands:**

1. **ping**: Sends ICMP echo request packets to a specified network host to check if it's reachable and measure round-trip time.
   Example:
   ```
   ping google.com
   ```

2. **netstat**: Displays network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships.
   Example:
   ```
   netstat -a
   ```

3. **ifconfig**: Configures network interfaces and displays information about them.
   Example:
   ```
   ifconfig
   ```

4. **traceroute vs tracepath**: Both commands trace the route that packets take to reach a network host, but `traceroute` uses ICMP packets while `tracepath` uses UDP.
   Example (traceroute):
   ```
   traceroute google.com
   ```

5. **mtr**: Combines the functionality of `ping` and `traceroute` by continuously probing network hosts and displaying statistics about the path taken.
   Example:
   ```
   mtr google.com
   ```

6. **nslookup**: Queries DNS servers to retrieve DNS information, such as IP addresses associated with domain names.
   Example:
   ```
   nslookup google.com
   ```

7. **telnet**: Establishes a connection to a remote host using the Telnet protocol.
   Example:
   ```
   telnet google.com 80
   ```

8. **hostname**: Displays or sets the hostname of the system.
   Example:
   ```
   hostname
   ```

9. **ip**: A versatile command for configuring and displaying network interfaces, routing, and tunnels.
   Example:
   ```
   ip addr show
   ```

10. **iwconfig**: Displays and configures wireless network interfaces.
    Example:
    ```
    iwconfig wlan0
    ```

11. **ss**: Another utility for investigating sockets, network connections, and routing tables.
    Example:
    ```
    ss -tuln
    ```

12. **arp**: Displays and modifies the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache.
    Example:
    ```
    arp -a
    ```

13. **dig**: A DNS lookup utility for querying DNS servers and retrieving DNS information.
    Example:
    ```
    dig google.com
    ```

14. **nc (netcat)**: A networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP.
    Example:
    ```
    nc -lvp 1234
    ```

15. **whois**: Retrieves information about domain registration, such as the owner's contact information and registration dates.
    Example:
    ```
    whois example.com
    ```

16. **ifplugstatus**: Checks the status of Ethernet or other network cables plugged into network interfaces.
    Example:
    ```
    ifplugstatus eth0
    ```

**Advanced Network Commands:**

1. **route**: Displays or modifies the IP routing table.
   Example:
   ```
   route -n
   ```

2. **nmap**: A powerful network scanning tool for discovering hosts and services on a network.
   Example:
   ```
   nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24
   ```

3. **wget**: Retrieves files from web servers using HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP protocols.
   Example:
   ```
   wget http://example.com/file.txt
   ```

4. **watch**: Repeatedly runs a command and displays its output, refreshing the screen.
   Example:
   ```
   watch -n 1 ifconfig
   ```

5. **iptables**: A powerful firewall utility for configuring packet filtering and network address translation (NAT).
   Example:
   ```
   iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
   ```

6. **traceroute**: Displays the route packets take to reach a network host, similar to `traceroute` command but using ICMP packets.
   Example:
   ```
   traceroute google.com
   ```

7. **curl vs wget**: Both utilities are used for downloading files from web servers, but `curl` supports more protocols and offers more features.
   Example (curl):
   ```
   curl -O http://example.com/file.txt
   ```

These examples illustrate how each command is used and provide practical insights into their functionalities for managing networks and troubleshooting connectivity issues.
